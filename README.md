Overview
This project demonstrates a fundamental implementation of an AI agent system, similar to those used in e-commerce customer support. It showcases how Large Language Models (LLMs) can interact with custom tools and follow structured decision-making processes to accomplish tasks.
Project Description
This implementation serves as an educational example of how modern AI agents work. The system demonstrates:

Integration with Gemini LLM for natural language understanding
Structured decision-making process (Understand → Plan → Action → Output)
Custom tool integration (weather data API as an example)
JSON-formatted conversation flow
Step-by-step processing of user queries

Key Features

Systematic Processing: Each query follows a defined workflow:

Understanding the user's intent
Planning the necessary actions
Executing actions using available tools
Generating appropriate responses


Tool Integration: Demonstrates how AI agents can access and utilize external tools (exemplified through a weather data function)
Structured Responses: Implements a consistent JSON-based format for all interactions, ensuring reliable and parseable outputs

Real-World Connection
This project mirrors the basic architecture of customer service AI agents found in e-commerce platforms, where:

Users submit natural language queries
The agent understands and processes requests
Relevant tools and databases are accessed
Appropriate responses are generated

Educational Value
This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding:

Basic AI agent architecture
LLM integration with custom tools
Structured conversation flows
System prompt engineering
JSON-based communication patterns

Use Case Example
The implemented weather query system demonstrates how AI agents can:

Process natural language inputs
Access specific tools (weather data)
Perform calculations when needed
Generate formatted responses

Technical Implementation

Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash model for language processing
Implements a system prompt for structured conversation flow
Includes error handling and JSON parsing
Demonstrates tool integration patterns

Future Scope
This basic implementation can be extended to:

Include more complex tool interactions
Handle multi-turn conversations
Implement memory and context management
Add authentication and user management
Integrate with actual APIs and databases

Getting Started

Clone the repository
Set up environment variables (GEN_AI_KEY)
Install dependencies
Run the example queries
Experiment with different inputs and tools

This project serves as a foundation for understanding how modern AI agents process requests and interact with custom tools in a structured manner.
